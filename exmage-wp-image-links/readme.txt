Add images using external links - Save your storage with EXMAGE effortlessly

== Description ==

EXMAGE - WordPress Image Links helps you save storage by using external image URLs. These images are shown in Media library like normal images so that you can choose them for post/product featured image, WooCommerce product gallery... or everywhere that images are chosen from Media library.

### Important Notice:

- This plugin only supports real image URLs that have correct image mime type. It does not support image URLs from an image hosting service(such as Flickr, Imgur, Photobucket ...) or a file storage service(such as Google drive)

- External images added by this plugin will no longer work if the plugin is not active

### FEATURES

- Ability to add single image URL on Upload files tab of the Media library

- Ability to add multiple image URLs at once on below the File upload on Upload New Media page

- External images have an icon to distinguish them from normal attachments.

- External images also have attachment ID like normal attachments so that you can use them wherever that allows to insert images from Media library such as Post/Product featured image, product gallery images, variation image, product category image...

- Compatible with ALD plugin: when this plugin is active, there will be an option named "Use external links for images" in the ALD plugin settings/Products. By enabling this option, AliExpress products imported by ALD plugin will use original AliExpress image URLs for product featured images, gallery images and variation images instead of saving images to your server.
